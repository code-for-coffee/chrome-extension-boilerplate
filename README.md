## Challenge
* Create a small extension that has **permission** to read from your HTML page. Hint: You will need to research the *manifest* for a Chrome Extension to complete this.
* When you click a button on your extension, record the `window.location` of the current active tab.
* Append this information to a `<ul>` inside of your Chrome extension.
